title: Image resizing demo
---

We are going to use this image:

![[/assets/dune.webp]]

Flowershow supports [Obsidian style image sizing](https://help.obsidian.md/embeds#Embed+an+image+in+a+note)

## Make it 100px wide

```md
![[/assets/dune.webp|100]]
```

![[/assets/dune.webp|100]]

## Change width and height

This will look a bit weird

```md
![[/assets/dune.webp|100x20]]
```

![[/assets/dune.webp|100x20]]
